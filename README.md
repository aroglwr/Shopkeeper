# Shopkeeper
## What is this?
This is a Discord bot built on [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

## Usage
I recommend using an IDE such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the paths are referenced from the root folder of the project.
1. Supply `src/config.json` with API tokens and data following the same format as [config.json.example](src/config.json.example)
2. Run `src/main.py`

## Features
