# Shopkeeper
## What is this?
This is a Discord bot built on [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

## Usage
I recommend using an IDE such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the paths are referenced from the root folder of the project.
1. Supply `src/config.json` with API tokens following the same format as [config.json.example](src/config.json.example) or run `autostart.py` and follow instructions
2. Supply `src/data.json` with various info following the same format as [data.json.example](src/data.json.example)
3. Run `src/main.py`
